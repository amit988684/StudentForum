Problems Faced : 

1 ) Whenever a teacher sends an assignment through the mail , it gets mixed up with all the other mails and gets lost , 
whenever i want to find a specific assignment i have to search through the whole mail for the particular mail.

2 ) Whenever a students had to ask a question to the teacher he has to wait for the opening of college or mail him directly ,
suppose many people get the same doubt , the teacher will be spammed with the mail, and also suppose by some reason the student
is not able to ask the teacher the question in college.

Solution : 

1 ) The assignment tab will make the work easier all the assignment related to all the courses and for particular semester will
be available in that place ,
The teacher will have the privilage to add assinments and whether to share them or not with the students of particular semester.

2 ) The student teacher interaction forum will help in asking question to the teacher or the fellow students, wheere anyone can
comment to give the answer.

3 ) chatting app will also be present which will make user to chat with each other to discuss any topic privatly.
4 ) calender app which allow the user to have events on the page which matter the most. like the exams , birthdays , deadlines of assignments etc.
